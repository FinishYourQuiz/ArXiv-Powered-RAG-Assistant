Explain to a beginner in AI. | 69.92406606674194 | Backpropagation is a technique used in neural networks to train the network to perform a task. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases of the network, and then using this gradient to update the weights and biases. The gradient of the loss function is calculated by taking the partial derivatives of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases. This is done by using the chain rule, which states that the gradient of a function with |
